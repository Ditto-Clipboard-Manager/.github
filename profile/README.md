## What is Ditto?

**Ditto** is a powerful, open-source clipboard manager for Windows that saves everything you copy — text, images, links, and more — allowing you to access your clipboard history anytime. Unlike the standard Windows clipboard, which only remembers the last item, Ditto stores hundreds of entries, making it ideal for multitasking, coding, writing, and productivity.

With Ditto, you can:
- **Retrieve anything you’ve copied** — no more lost snippets.
- **Search your clipboard history** instantly.
- **Sync clipboard data** across multiple computers (with optional extensions).
- **Assign hotkeys** for quick access.

Ditto is lightweight, highly customizable, and trusted by developers, writers, and professionals worldwide. It’s completely free and actively maintained by the open-source community.
